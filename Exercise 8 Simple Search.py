# Exercise 8
# Declaring a list
Names1 = ["Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"]
# Creating an input to enter the name to see if the name is in the list
input = input("Enter your name: ")
# If the name is founded, we print it along with the index
print(input, "is at Index", Names1.index(input))
